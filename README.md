**Mostly Jupyter Notebooks with Keras and TensorFlow**  

There are numerous sources of knowledge, including tutorials, notebooks, and lessons. However, due to the rapid evolution of Keras (TensorFlow), 
many of these tutorials become obsolete quickly.  

While it is possible to use Anaconda or other methods to downgrade your Python and Keras (TensorFlow) versions to match the tutorial,  
I always strive to stay up to date.

Therefore, I will upload the notebooks of the tutorials here after migrating them to Keras 2 or Keras 3.
